      <p><div class="panel-body text-justify"> Sports have always played an important role in my life. I've been playing <strong>basketball</strong> since I was 4 years old and have always been curious to discover and watch new sports. I think that by playing sports, a person can improve their <strong>communication skills</strong> and also learn to deal with <strong>adversity</strong>. It is also really important in my opinion to be able to <strong>relieve your stress</strong> and to discover the importance of working together as a <strong>team</strong>.

    <div class="clearfix">
      <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">I've always been extremely curious to see how other people live, work and interact. I took my first <strong>English</strong> class when I was 8 and I enjoyed it from the very beginning ! Since then I've always been working hard and I am now fluent in English. My year as an <strong>exchange student in the US</strong> helped me a lot obviously but I've had the chance to visit other <strong>English speaking countries</strong> - England and Ireland - where I also had the opportunity to practice. In addition, before going to the United States in 2013, I have had the tremendous privilege to be <strong>a translator during a Harlem Globe Trotter show</strong> that took place in Lorient, France. I also have a basic <strong>German</strong> level. My love for the English culture is the reason why I am looking for an internship in an English speaking country this summer.

      <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">INSAPP is a project I've started to work on in October 2016. It is a <strong>smartphone application</strong> dedicated to improve communication between the student societies and the students at INSA Rennes. The application was initially developed by Florent Thomas-Morel and Antoine Crochet. I've joined the team as an <strong>iOS developer</strong> and am very interested and motivated.

The 2017 edition will be the 12th and I will be responsible for the <strong>organisation of the Counter Strike: Global Offensive tournament</strong> with two other students. This is an opportunity for me to discover how such a big event is organised and I am very excited to see what adventures we're going to have before and during the event.
