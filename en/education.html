    <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">I am now studying <strong>software engineering</strong> at INSA Rennes - a school member of the INSA Group, the leading French network of state graduate and post graduate engineering schools. I am currently enrolled in my third year there and I'm having a lot of fun (yes, I do think that learning is fun) ! I really enjoy learning new things everyday and getting to apply them in <strong>projects</strong>. However I am also eager to discover things on my own so I'm trying to learn things by myself too. In addition to my courses, I am taking part in two projects :<br>
      - I am an <strong>iOS developer</strong> for the INSAPP, an application dedicated to student life at INSA Rennes<br>
      - I am organising a tournament for the <strong>InsaLan</strong>, a lan-party organised every year at INSA Rennes</li>

    <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">After finishing high school in France, I still wasn't very sure of what to do next. That is the reason why, after thinking about ir for quite a long time, I decided to cross the ocean and to become an <strong>exchange student</strong> for a year in the United States. During 10 months, I have been studying like an <strong>American high school student</strong> and living one of my dreams. It wasn't always simple : being that far from your family and friends can be hard sometimes. However I was very lucky to be surrounded by amazing people who have been extraordinary helpful. I was living in Butler, Alabama and was studying at Patrician Academy. This experience helped me become more <strong>independent</strong>, <strong>open-minded</strong>, discover how to deal with problems (and people) on my own and obviously significantly improve my <strong>English</strong>. After 10 months I <strong>graduated</strong> from my school and it was time for me to leave the new life I had built there. Even if it was extremely difficult, I was ready and excited to start the next chapter of my life...<br>
      Achievements :<br>
      - Advanced Honors Diploma (4.25 GPA)<br>
      - Member of the <strong>National Beta Club</strong> and <strong>National Honor Society</strong>

    <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">Those 3 years at Lyc&eacute;e Jean Mac&eacute; have been really great for me. This school helped me a lot to grow personally and to become the person I am today. During my 3 years there, I have studied mainly <strong>scientific subjects</strong> such as Biology, Mathematics and Physics. However the most important thing that I gained there is my passion for <strong>software engineering</strong> which I discovered during my last year when I took this extra course. I graduated from high school with high honours and was more than ready to start a new adventure !
