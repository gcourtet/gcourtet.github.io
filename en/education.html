  <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">I am now studying software engineering at INSA Rennes - a school member of the INSA Group, the leading French network of state graduate and post graduate engineering schools. I am currently enrolled in my third year there and I'm having a lot of fun (yes, I do think that learning is fun) ! I really enjoy learning new things everyday and getting to apply them in projects. However I am also eager to discover things on my own so I'm trying to learn things by myself too. In addition to my courses, I am taking part in two projects :<br>
    - I am an iOS developer for the INSAPP, an application dedicated to student life at INSA Rennes<br>
    - I am organising a tournament for the InsaLan, a lan-party organised every year at INSA Rennes</li>

  <div class="clearfix">
  <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">After finishing high school in France, I still wasn't very sure of what to do next. That is the reason why, after thinking about ir for quite a long time, I decided to cross the ocean and to become an exchange student for a year in the United States. During 10 months, I have been studying like an American high school student and living one of my dreams. It wasn't always simple : being that far from your family and friends can be hard sometimes. However I was very lucky to be surrounded by amazing people who have been extraordinary helpful. I was living in Butler, Alabama and was studying at Patrician Academy. This experience helped me become more independent, open-minded, discover how to deal with problems (and people) on my own and obviously significantly improve my English. After 10 months I graduated from my school and it was time for me to leave the new life I had built there. Even if it was extremely difficult, I was ready and excited to start the next chapter of my life...<br>
  Achievements :<br>
   - Advanced Honors Diploma (4.25 GPA)<br>
   - Member of the National Beta Club and National Honor Society

    <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">Those 3 years at Lyc&eacute;e Jean Mac&eacute; have been really great for me. This school helped me a lot to grow personally and to become the person I am today. During my 3 years there, I have studied mainly scientific subjects such as Biology, Mathematics and Physics. However the most important thing that I gained there is my passion for software engineering which I discovered during my last year when I took this extra course. I graduated from high school with high honours and was more than ready to start a new adventure !
