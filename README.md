My personal website

I created this website so that I could discover new programming languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript).
It was a lot of fun and I will for sure tri to improve it as much as I can.
Another goal was to give to potential employers more informations about myself than what they can find on my resume.

Please do not hesitate to let me know if you spot a problem on the website.
