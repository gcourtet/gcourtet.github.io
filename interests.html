    <div class="clearfix">
      <p><div class="panel-body text-justify"> Sports have always played an important role in my life. I've been playing basketball since I was 4 years old and have always been curious to discover and watch new sports. I think that by playing sports, a person can improve their communication skills and also learn to deal with adversity. It is also really important in my opinion to be able to relieve your stress and to discover the importance of working together as a team.

    <div class="clearfix">
      <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">I've always been extremely curious to see how other people live, work and interact. I took my first English class when I was 8 and I found it amazing ! Since then I've always been working hard and I am now fluent in English. My trip to the US helped me a lot obviously but I've had the chance to visit other countries where I also had the opportunity to practice. In addition, before going to the United States in 2013, I have had the tremendous privilege to be the translator during a Harlem Globe Trotter show that took place in Lorient, France. I also have a basic German level. My love for the English culture is the reason why I am looking for an internship in an English-speaking country this summer.

    <div class="clearfix">
      <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">INSAPP is a project I've started to work on in October 2016. It is a smartphone application dedicated to improve communication between the students societies and the students at INSA Rennes. The application was initially developed by Florent Thomas-Morel and Antoine Crochet. I've joined the team as an iOS developer and am very interested and motivated.

The 2017 edition will be the 12th and I will be responsible for the organisation of the Counter Strike: Global Offensive tournament with two other students. This is an opportunity for me to discover how such a big event is organised and I am very excited to see what surprises we're going to have before and during the event.
