      <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">During my month with METI, I've had the opportunity to disover the evolution of a project inside a company from scratch to a complete product. I was navigating from one service to another in order to really get an idea of what it is like to work on a project inside a company. By doing so, I was able to learn a lot of very interesting things on the different aspects of a project : development, validation, schedule management and finally support. My internship at METI was a great experience and I look forward to my next internship.

      <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">Being a student is great but if you want to really enjoy all the aspects of student life, you have to earn some money and to stop being completely dependent on your parents. That was the purpose of my two summers at E.Lecler : earn some money. However I was surprised to also learn a lot of things especially on how difficult it can be to work in a team sometimes but also how difficult it can be to manage a team. It was an interesting experience to work at E.Leclerc and these summer jobs helped me to do really nice personal activities afterwards.

      <p><div class="panel-body text-justify">I was only 15 years old when I started being a referee for the French Basketball Federation (FFBB) and I was officiating on games where the players where sometimes 20 years older than me... Imagine that : a kid trying to tell you wether you do things correctly or not and having more authority than you on the court. Some players had trouble understanding that and that enabled to learn how to be respected when it is needed but also how to talk to other people and try to covince them and to stay very calm and respectful while doing it. Once again it was a very genuine experience and I have learned a lot on myself during the 3 years I've spent officiating.
